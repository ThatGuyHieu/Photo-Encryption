## Summary

This project is a Photo-Encryption program in C++ that uses a Fibonacci Linear Feedback Shift Register algorithm (LFSR).
The program will generate random bits by simulating a LFSR and will be used to create a simple encryption device for digital photos. In the latest version of this project, we completed the full program with the help of the LFSR.
